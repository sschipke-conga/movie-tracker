## Learning Goals

This was a group project for Mod Three at Turing. The major focus was to further develop our skills utilizing React while learning the new processes of Redux. All while further honing our understanding of network requests with an API and backend. It was extremely important for us to work on our expertise, while focusing on testing as much as possible during the one week project.
